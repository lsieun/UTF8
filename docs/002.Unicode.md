## Core

Unicode最本质的概念：建立Character与Code Point之间的映射。

## Unicode Consortium

The **Unicode Consortium** (Unicode Inc.) is **a non-profit organization** based in Mountain View, California.

> Unicode Consortium是一个非盈利性机构，位于美国的California。

Its primary purpose is to maintain and publish **the Unicode Standard** which was developed with the intention of replacing existing character encoding schemes which are limited in size and scope, and are incompatible with multilingual environments. 

> Unicode Consortium的主要目的就是发布Unicode Standard。

Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread adoption in the internationalization and localization of software. The standard has been implemented in many recent technologies, including XML, the Java programming language, Swift, and modern operating systems.

## Unicode Versions

**The Unicode Consortium** first published **The Unicode Standard** in 1991 (**version 1.0**), and has published new versions on a regular basis since then. The latest version of **the Unicode Standard**, **version 12.0**, was released in March 2019, and is available in electronic format from the consortium's website.

## Code point planes and blocks

In the Unicode standard, a **plane** is a continuous group of 65,536 (2<sup>16</sup>) code points. There are 17 planes, identified by the numbers 0 to 16. **Plane 0** is the **Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)**, which contains most commonly-used characters. The higher planes 1 through 16 are called "**supplementary planes**". The very last code point in Unicode is the last code point in plane 16, U+10FFFF. As of Unicode version 12.0, six of the planes have assigned code points (characters), and four are named.

The **Unicode codespace** is divided into seventeen **planes**, numbered `0` to `16`:

| Plane         | Range          | Name                                   | Abbr     |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `Plane 0`     | `0000-FFFF`    | Basic Multilingual Plane               | BMP      |
| `Plane 1`     | `10000-1FFFF`  | Supplementary Multilingual Plane       | SMP      |
| `Plane 2`     | `20000-2FFFF`  | Supplementary Ideographic Plane        | SIP      |
| `Plane 3`     | `30000-3FFFF`  | Tertiary Ideographic Plane             | TIP      |
| `Plane 4-13`  | `40000-DFFFF`  | unassigned                             | -        |
| `Plane 14`    | `E0000-EFFFF`  | Supplement­ary Special-purpose Plane   | SSP      |
| `Plane 15-16` | `F0000-10FFFF` | Supplement­ary Private Use Area planes | SPUA-A/B |



## Unique encoding for a character

The idea of Unicode is to assign a “**Unique code point**” to every character and symbol, such that each has a unique position. For example, the Latin upper-case letter “A” is `U+0041`.

By design, the first 256 codes were identical to ISO-8859-1 so as to make it **trivial** to convert existing western text. On the code charts on this page you can see the Unicode code point for each character shown. (U+xxxx where “xxxx” is a hexadecimal number).

> trivial是“轻松、随便、小菜一碟”的意思。

The Unicode space was broken into blocks — where a block of codes would be reserved for use by a particular human language. Unicode characters also include punctuation, mathematical and musical symbols, emoji and so on.

```txt
Each code point has a name. For example U+0061 is named:

    LATIN SMALL LETTER A

Names are unique, and once assigned cannot be changed.
```

## Languages with many symbols

Languages such as Chinese and Japanese have many different characters (over 50,000) which makes it impossible to store them into a single byte. Hence some form of multi-byte representation was needed.
