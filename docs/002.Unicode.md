## Unique encoding for a character

The idea of Unicode is to assign a “**Unique code point**” to every character and symbol, such that each has a unique position. For example, the Latin upper-case letter “A” is `U+0041`.

By design, the first 256 codes were identical to ISO-8859-1 so as to make it **trivial** to convert existing western text. On the code charts on this page you can see the Unicode code point for each character shown. (U+xxxx where “xxxx” is a hexadecimal number).

> trivial是“轻松、随便、小菜一碟”的意思。

The Unicode space was broken into blocks — where a block of codes would be reserved for use by a particular human language. Unicode characters also include punctuation, mathematical and musical symbols, emoji and so on.

```txt
Each code point has a name. For example U+0061 is named:

    LATIN SMALL LETTER A

Names are unique, and once assigned cannot be changed.
```

## Languages with many symbols

Languages such as Chinese and Japanese have many different characters (over 50,000) which makes it impossible to store them into a single byte. Hence some form of multi-byte representation was needed.
