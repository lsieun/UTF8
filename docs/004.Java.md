# Java Language and Unicode Characters

Java offers the following built-in classes to support Unicode character set, local language character subsets, and their encodings:

- `java.nio.charset.Charset` - Defined in the JDK document as "A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode code units and sequences of bytes. This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and for retrieving the various names associated with a charset. Instances of this class are immutable." The "Charset" class represents a particular character encoding defined a particular character set.
- `java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder` - Defined in the JDK document as "An engine that can transform a sequence of sixteen-bit Unicode characters into a sequence of bytes in a specific charset."
- `java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder` - Defined in the JDK document as "An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset into a sequence of sixteen-bit Unicode characters."

Conclusions:

- From JDK 1.0 to JDK 1.4, Java can only support BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) characters.
- From J2SE 5.0 (JDK 1.5) to any newer versions, Java can support the full range, `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`, of Unicode characters.

- "Character" objects can not represent all Unicode characters any more. Store code points as "int" values represent Unicode characters.
- The "Character" class offers static utility methods to help Unicode character processing.

- The `length()` method on a "String" object returns the number of "char" elements used to store Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.
- The `codePointCount()` method on a "String" object returns the number of Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.
- The `toCharArray()` method on a "String" object returns the UTF-16BE encoded "char" sequence of Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.

- Non-ASCII characters can be represented as `\uXXXX` escape sequences follow the UTF-16 encoding rule in Java String literals.
- Non-ASCII characters can also be represented as UTF-8 encoding byte sequences follow the UTF-16 encoding rule in Java String literals. But the source code must be stored in UTF-8 encoding and compiled with the "-encoding UTF8" option.
