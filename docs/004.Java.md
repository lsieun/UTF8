# Java Language and Unicode Characters


Conclusions:

- From JDK 1.0 to JDK 1.4, Java can only support BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) characters.
- From J2SE 5.0 (JDK 1.5) to any newer versions, Java can support the full range, `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`, of Unicode characters.

- "Character" objects can not represent all Unicode characters any more. Store code points as "int" values represent Unicode characters.
- The "Character" class offers static utility methods to help Unicode character processing.

- The `length()` method on a "String" object returns the number of "char" elements used to store Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.
- The `codePointCount()` method on a "String" object returns the number of Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.
- The `toCharArray()` method on a "String" object returns the UTF-16BE encoded "char" sequence of Unicode characters represented by the "String" object.

- Non-ASCII characters can be represented as \uXXXX escape sequences follow the UTF-16 encoding rule in Java String literals.
- Non-ASCII characters can also be represented as UTF-8 encoding byte sequences follow the UTF-16 encoding rule in Java String literals. But the source code must be stored in UTF-8 encoding and compiled with the "-encoding UTF8" option.
