# 'int' and 'String' - Basic Data Types for Unicode

URL: ['int' and 'String' - Basic Data Types for Unicode](http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/Java-int-and-String-Data-Type-for-Unicode.html)

This section provides an introduction on **basic data types** for storing Unicode characters in the full range of `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`: '`int`' for **a single Unicode character**; '`String`' for **a sequence of Unicode characters**.

As we learned from the previous section, the **primitive type** "char" is no longer capable to support **Unicode characters** in the full range of `U+0000` to `U+10FFFF`. The best way to write Unicode-friendly Java applications with J2SE 5.0 or higher is to:

- Always use "`int`" **primitive type** to store **a single Unicode character**.
- Always use "`String`" **class type** to store **a sequence of Unicode characters**.

Other **primitive types** and **class types** can still be used to help managing **Unicode characters**, but you need to remember their risks and limitations:

- "`byte`" primitive type can only support ASCII characters in the range of `U+0000` to `U+00FF`.
- "`char`" primitive type can only support **BMP** (Basic Multilingual Plane) characters in the range of `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`.
- "`Character`" class type can only support **BMP** (Basic Multilingual Plane) characters in the range of `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`.
- "`char[]`" array type should only be used to store UTF-16BE encoded "char" sequences of Unicode characters.

Examples of using Unicode-friendly data types:

```java
int letterC = 0x43; // ASCII character
int degreeCelsius = 0x2103; // BMP character
int squaredC = 0x1F132; // Supplementary character

StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder();
buffer.appendCodePoint(letterC);
buffer.appendCodePoint(degreeCelsius);
buffer.appendCodePoint(squaredC);
String unicodeString = new String(buffer);
System.out.println(unicodeString);
```
