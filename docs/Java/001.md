# Unicode Versions Supported in Java-History

This section provides a quick summary of different Unicode versions supported in Java history. A major change was introduced in **J2SE 5** to support **Unicode 4.0** which contains supplementary characters in the range of `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF`.

Unicode has been supported in the Java language since its first release in 1996. Both Unicode and Java have evolved with multiple versions and releases since then. Here is a summary of which version of Unicode is supported in which Java releases.

```

From `JDK 1.0` to `JDK 1.4`, Java can only support Unicode code points in the range of `U+0000` to `U+FFFF`. Unicode characters in this range are called **BMP** (Basic Multilingual Plane) characters.

Designers of JDK 1.0 used the following **primitive types** **and built-in class types** to support Unicode **BMP** characters in very natural way:

**char** - A primitive type with 16-bit storage size, which is perfected designed to store the code point value of a single BMP character.

**java.lang.Character** - A built-in class that wraps a value of the primitive type char in an object. The `Character` class is perfectly designed to represent **a single BMP character** as an object. The `Character` class also provides some useful `static` methods for managing individual BMP characters.

**java.lang.String** - A built-in class that wraps an array of primitive type char in an object. The `String` class is perfectly designed to represent **a sequence of BMP characters** as an object. The `String` class also provides some useful static and instance methods for managing a string of BMP characters.

Starting in `J2SE 5.0`, support of Unicode code points in the range of `U+10000` to `U+10FFFF` was introduced in Java. Unicode characters in this range are called **supplementary characters**, implemented in Unicode 3.1 in 2001.

Designers of J2SE 5.0 did not introduce any **new primitive types** and **built-in class types** to support **Unicode supplementary characters**. What they did was:

- Use the existing primitive type `int` to represent a single **supplementary character** by storing its code point value as is.
- Use the existing primitive array type `char[]` to represent a sequence of **supplementary characters** by one **surrogate char pair** per supplementary character.

The **surrogate char pair** of a supplementary character is really the `UTF-16BE` encoded char sequence of the **supplementary character**.

> surrogate char pair。我的理解是这样的：supplementary character需要用4个byte才能进行存储，而char的大小是2个byte，当要存储它，就需要使用2个char，称之为char pair。理想的情况下，存储supplementary character是使用一个4个byte的类型来存储，这个char pair就起到了替代（surrogate）的作用。

Using **UTF-16BE encoded char sequences** to represent **supplementary characters** does give **one main advantage** to the existing class type `String`: A `String` object can still be viewed as a **char sequence** that represent a sequence of any Unicode characters: BMP characters and/or supplementary characters.

If you are interested in why `J2SE 5.0` designers did not choose to add a new primitive type like `char32` to help support **supplementary characters**, read the article "Supplementary Characters in the Java Platform" by Norbert Lindenberg and Masayoshi Okutsu at [oracle.com/us/technologies/java/supplementary-142654.html](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/supplementary-142654.html).
