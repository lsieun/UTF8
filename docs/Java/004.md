# Testing decode() Methods

URL: [Testing decode() Methods](http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/Java-charset-Test-decode-Method.html)

This section describes 4 different methods provided in Java to decode **byte sequences** back to **characters** with a given encoding.

There are 4 methods provided in Java 11 to decode characters:

- CharsetDecoder.decode()
- Charset.decode()
- new String()
- InputStreamReader.read()

The way to use those methods is similar to encode methods described in previous sections.

Exercise: Write a Java program to decode byte sequences back to Unicode character code points.
